# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
coctail_balance_raw <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
coctail_balance_clean <- coctail_balance_raw %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>% #separating rows by a given string in the character vector
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br>") %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<b/>") #this seems to be wrong at row 94

coctail_balance_clean$ingredients <- str_replace_all(coctail_balance_clean$ingredients, pattern = "\\b\\d+[%/\\d]*\\s*(?:oz|dash|fl[\\s.]?oz|abv)\\b", replacement = "")
coctail_balance_clean$ingredients <- str_replace_all(coctail_balance_clean$ingredients, pattern = "[:digit:]", replacement = "")
coctail_balance_clean$ingredients <- str_replace_all(coctail_balance_clean$ingredients, pattern = "\\.", replacement = "")
coctail_balance_clean$ingredients <- str_replace_all(coctail_balance_clean$ingredients, pattern = "\\(\\)", replacement = "")
coctail_balance_clean$ingredients <- str_trim(coctail_balance_clean$ingredients)

#this was an extremely redundant call of regex functions but this is the best i can do for now with regex
#also i had a hard time using the %>% operator with stringr so I stayed with the base R option with the $ operator
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredients_names <- sort(tolower(unique(coctail_balance_clean$ingredients)))
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
number_of_ingredients <- length(ingredients_names) - 1 # i subtract one because of the unique 45th element of vector is wrong
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
top10_ing <- coctail_balance_clean %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10, wt = n)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
top_coctails <- coctail_balance_clean %>%
  count(name, sort = TRUE) # this works since the dataset was longered by ingredients
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ing <- coctail_balance_clean %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n == 1)

n_rare_ing <- length(rare_ing$ingredients)
print(n_rare_ing)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
coctails_with_rare <- coctail_balance_clean %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% rare_ing$ingredients) %>%
  select(name) %>%
  unique()
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
'%ni%' <- Negate("%in%")

coctails <- coctail_balance_clean %>%
  select(name)%>%
  unique()

common_coctails <- filter(coctails, name %ni% coctails_with_rare$name)

```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
ingredient_matrix <- matrix("", length(ingredients_names), length(coctails$name))

colnames(ingredient_matrix) = coctails$name
rownames(ingredient_matrix) = ingredients_names

colnames(ingredient_matrix) <- matrixcoloumns
rownames(ingredient_matrix) <- matrixrows

xer <- function() {
  ifelse(str_detect(ingredients_names, pattern = matrixcoloumns), ingredient_matrix[] <- "X", "")
}

apply(ingredient_matrix,c(1,2), xer)

#i don't know how to select to proper matrix indeces but the ide would be to at each element in the matrix check the logical value of "is the coloumn name present in the list of ingredients?" if yes, put an "X", if no, put an ""


```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
