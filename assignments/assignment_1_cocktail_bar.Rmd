# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
raw_cocktail <- read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.


```{r}
cocktails <- raw_cocktail %>% 
  separate(ingredients, 
           sep = "<br/>|<br>|<b4/>", 
           into = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6")
           ) %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"),
               names_to = "ingredient_number",
               values_to = "ingredient") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(ingredient)) %>% 
  mutate(ingredient = str_remove_all(
          ingredient,
          "(\\d/\\d)|(^\\d+)|(\\.\\d+)|(oz)|(drops)|(drop)|(bsp)|(dashes)|(dash)|(\\u008f)|\\(\\d+%\\sabv\\)|\\(\\d+\\.\\d%\\sabv\\)")) %>% 
  mutate(ingredient = str_trim(ingredient)) %>% 
  mutate(ingredient = str_to_title(ingredient))
  
#Removing duplicates

duplic_vec <- cocktails %>% 
   select(name, ingredient) %>% 
   duplicated()

cocktails <- cocktails %>% 
  filter(!duplic_vec)
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
sort(unique(cocktails$ingredient))

```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
length(sort(unique(cocktails$ingredient)))

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
cocktails %>% 
  select(ingredient) %>% 
  count(ingredient) %>% 
  slice_max(order_by = n, n = 10)

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
n_ingr_max <- max(cocktails$ingredient_number)

cocktails %>% 
  filter(ingredient_number == n_ingr_max) %>% 
  pull(name)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
rare_ingredients <- cocktails %>% 
  select(ingredient) %>% 
  count(ingredient) %>% 
  filter(n == 1) %>% 
  pull(ingredient)
print(rare_ingredients)

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
cocktail_w_rare <- cocktails %>%
  filter(ingredient %in% rare_ingredients) %>% 
  pull(name) %>% 
  unique()
print(cocktail_w_rare)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
cocktails %>% 
  filter(!(name %in% cocktail_w_rare), !(ingredient %in% rare_ingredients)) %>% 
  pull(name) %>% 
  unique()
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
cheat_sheet <- cocktails %>%
  mutate(value = "X") %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = name,
            names_from = ingredient,
            names_sort = TRUE,
            values_fill = list(names = "")
            ) %>%
  replace(is.na(.), "") %>%
  arrange(name) %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "name")

DT::datatable(
  cheat_sheet, 
  extensions = 'FixedColumns',
  options = list(
    scrollX = TRUE,
    fixedColumns = TRUE
  )
)


```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
