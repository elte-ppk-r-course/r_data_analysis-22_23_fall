# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(rmarkdown)
library(stringr)
library(tidytext) # Tidytext package is needed for exercise 8
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
cocktail_data <- read.delim("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv", sep = "\t")
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}
cleaned_cocktail_data <- cocktail_data %>%  
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>|<br>") %>% # A few ingredients are separated differently
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "\\d+|oz|%|abv", "")) %>% # Removing the required units
  mutate(ingredients = str_replace_all(ingredients, "[()/\\.]", "")) %>% # Additional cell cleaning
  mutate(ingredients = str_squish(ingredients)) %>% # Stripping blank spaces from start of the cells
  unique() # Removing duplicate lines because of exercise 6
```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
ingredient_list <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>% # Selecting unique ingredients
  pull(ingredients) %>% # Extracting ingredients column as a vector
  sort() # Sorting the ingredients in alphabetical order

print(ingredient_list) # Printing out the list for the supplier
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
# Calculate the number of unique ingredients
num_unique_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  distinct(ingredients) %>%
  nrow()

# Print the result
print(num_unique_ingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
# Get the top 10 most frequently used ingredients
top_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  top_n(10)

# Print the top ingredients
print(top_ingredients)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
# Count the number of ingredients for each cocktail
cocktail_ingredient_count <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarise(num_ingredients = n_distinct(ingredients))

# Find the maximum ingredient count
max_ingredient_count <- max(cocktail_ingredient_count$num_ingredients)

# Filter the cocktails with the maximum ingredient count
cocktails_with_max_ingredients <- cocktail_ingredient_count %>%
  filter(num_ingredients == max_ingredient_count) %>%
  pull(name)

# Print the names of the cocktails with the most ingredients
print(cocktails_with_max_ingredients)
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
# Count the frequency of each ingredient
ingredient_frequency <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  count(ingredients)

# Count the number of ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
num_rare_ingredients <- sum(ingredient_frequency$n == 1)

# Print the result
print(num_rare_ingredients)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}
# Count the number of cocktails each ingredient appears in
ingredient_counts <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  unnest_tokens(ingredient, ingredients) %>% # Tidytext package
  group_by(ingredient) %>%
  summarise(num_cocktails = n_distinct(name))

# Filter ingredients that appear in only one cocktail
rare_ingredients <- ingredient_counts %>%
  filter(num_cocktails == 1)

# Filter cocktails that have rare ingredients
cocktails_with_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  unnest_tokens(ingredient, ingredients) %>%
  filter(ingredient %in% rare_ingredients$ingredient) %>%
  distinct(name)  # Keep only distinct cocktail names

# Print the names of the cocktails with rare ingredients
print(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients$name)
```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
# Filter cocktails that do not have rare ingredients
cocktails_without_rare_ingredients <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  anti_join(cocktails_with_rare_ingredients, by = "name") %>%
  distinct(name)  # Keep only distinct cocktail names

# Print the names of the cocktails without rare ingredients
print(cocktails_without_rare_ingredients$name)
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}
# Pivot the data to create the matrix
cocktail_matrix <- cleaned_cocktail_data %>%
  select(name, ingredients) %>%
  separate_rows(ingredients, sep = "<br/>") %>%
  mutate(ingredient_presence = "X") %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = ingredients, values_from = ingredient_presence, values_fill = "") %>%
  relocate(name, everything())
```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
