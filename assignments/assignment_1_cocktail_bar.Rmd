# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(stringr)



```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv", sep = "\t")

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}

#clears the datastrings

data_cleaned <- data %>%  
  mutate(ingredients = strsplit(as.character(ingredients), "<br/>|<br>|<b/>")) %>% 
  unnest(ingredients) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub('[[:digit:]]','',ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub('[^[:alnum:] ]','',ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("\\oz\\b","",ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("abv","",ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("drops","",ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("dashes","",ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("dash","",ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = gsub("drop","",ingredients)) %>%
  mutate(ingredients = str_squish(ingredients))
 
#Creates a list of ingredients that only appear in one coctail

RareIngredients <- data_cleaned %>% 
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n < 2)  
  

#Create a list of coctail names sorted by alphabetical order

Coctails_all <- data$name
Coctails_all <-sort(Coctails_all)
  


  
  

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
#Create a list of ingredients

listofingredients <-  unique(data_cleaned$ingredients)

#Sort ingredients by alphabet

listofingredients <-sort(listofingredients)

 
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
#counts the number of ingredients

Countofingredients <- length(listofingredients)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
#TopIngredients contains the 10 most frequently used ones

top_ingredients <- data_cleaned %>% 
  count(ingredients, sort = TRUE) %>%
  head(11)
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

#Filter those coctails that have the most ingredients 6
most_ingredients <- data_cleaned %>%
  count(name, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n == 6)

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
#Coctails that have only one ingredient
Coctailswith1ingredient <- data_cleaned %>%
  count(name, sort = TRUE) %>%
  filter(n < 2)
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

Coctails_withRare <- data_cleaned %>%
  filter(ingredients %in% RareIngredients$ingredients) %>% 
  distinct(name)

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
Coctails_notRare <- data_cleaned %>%
  filter(!name %in% Coctails_withRare$name) %>%
  distinct(name)
  
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

# Initialize empty result matrix
cheatsheet_matrix <- matrix(nrow = length(Coctails_all), ncol = length(listofingredients))

rownames(cheatsheet_matrix) <- Coctails_all

# Set the column names to the ingredient names
colnames(cheatsheet_matrix) <- listofingredients

# Loop through cocktails
for(j in 1:length(Coctails_all)) {
  
  # Filter data frame by cocktail name
  Namesandcoctails <- data_cleaned %>% filter(name == Coctails_all[j])
  
  # Initialize empty row vector
  row <- rep("", length(listofingredients))
  
  # Loop through ingredients
  for (i in 1:length(listofingredients)) {
    if(listofingredients[i] %in%  Namesandcoctails$ingredients) {
       row[i] <- "X"
    }
  }
  
  # Add row to result matrix
  cheatsheet_matrix[j,] <- row
}
```




Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
