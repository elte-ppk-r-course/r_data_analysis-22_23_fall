# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

### Solution

The easiest method is to get the url of the "raw" version of the datafile. Since it is a .tsv file for simplicity I used the read.tsv function from the library readr.

```{r}

df = read_tsv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")

```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

### Solution

Since the solution might contain regular expressions (regex) which is a nightmare to work with, I created a cell where I show how I tried to solve the problem of cleaning the strings. A more elegant solution would be finding a regex which detects every number and the first word after a number.

#### Manual cleaning
```{r}

test = df[1,8]
#(?<=\bipsum\s)(\w+)

test %>% str_remove_all("[:digit:]") %>% str_remove_all("oz|drops|dashes|dash|drop|abv|% abv|[()]|/")

test_wo_n = str_remove_all(test, "[:digit:]")
test_wo_n
test_clear = str_remove_all(test_wo_n, "oz|drops|dashes|dash|drop|abv|% abv|[()]|/")
str_squish(test_clear)
test_clean = as.vector(str_split(str_squish(test_clear), "<br>", simplify = TRUE))
test_clean_new = c()
for(i in 1:length(test_clean)){
  test_clean_new[i] = str_remove_all(test_clean[i], " ")
}
```

#### Cleaning Function

```{r}

str_cleaner = function(str){
  clean_str = str %>% 
    str_remove_all("[:digit:]") %>%
      str_remove_all("oz|drops|dashes|dash|drop|abv|% abv|[()]|/|[.]") %>%
        str_squish() %>%
          str_split("<br>", simplify = TRUE)
  
  clean_str = as.vector(clean_str)
  clean_new = c()
  for(i in 1:length(clean_str)){
    clean_new[i] = str_remove_all(clean_str[i], " ")
  }
  return(clean_new)
}

```

#### Creating the long dataset
Probably there is a tidyverse way to make this new long data format, but I have a very strong opinion about tidyverse, so I will rather present a base R solution for the problem. 

```{r}


df_clean = data.frame()
clean_strings = list()
for(rows in 1:nrow(df)){
  current_cell = df[rows, 8]
  clean_string = str_cleaner(current_cell)
  clean_strings[[rows]] = clean_string
  df_clean = rbind(df_clean, df[rep(rows, length(clean_string)), ])
}

list_of_ings = unlist(clean_strings)
df_clean[, 8] = list_of_ings

df_clean

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
sorted_ings = sort(list_of_ings)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}
unique_ings = unique(sorted_ings)
length(unique_ings)
```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}
sort(table(sorted_ings), decreasing = TRUE)[1:10]
```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}
most_ing_index = which.max(lapply(clean_strings, length))

df[2,1]
```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}
names(which(table(sorted_ings) == 1))
```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tribble(~name, ~Lime, ~`White rum`, ~`Cane sugar`, ~`Coca-cola`, ~Mint, ~Soda,
        "Caipirissima", "X", "X", "X", "", "", "",
        "Cuba Libre", "X", "X", "", "X","","",
        "Mojito", "X", "X", "", "", "X", "X") %>% 
    relocate(name, sort(names(.)))
```

```{r}

df = as.data.frame(df)
df_clean = as.data.frame(df_clean)

n_cocktails = nrow(df)
ing_matrix = matrix("", n_cocktails, length(unique_ings)+1)
colnames(ing_matrix) = c("names", names(table(sorted_ings)))
rownames(ing_matrix) = df[,1]
ing_matrix

for(i in 1:nrow(df_clean)){
  current_ing = df_clean[i,8]
  current_cocktail = df_clean[i, 1]
  ing_matrix[current_cocktail, current_ing] = "X"
}

```


Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
